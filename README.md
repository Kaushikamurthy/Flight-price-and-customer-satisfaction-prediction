 #  Flight Price & Customer Satisfaction Prediction App

A dual-purpose machine learning application developed using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **MLflow** to predict:

-  **Flight prices** based on route, airline, and timing data *(Regression)*
-  **Customer satisfaction** based on flight experience features *(Classification)*

---

##  Projects Overview

### **Project 1: Flight Price Prediction**

- **Goal:** Predict flight ticket prices based on travel details.
- **Techniques Used:** Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, MLflow, Streamlit
- **Dataset:** `Flight_Price.csv`

####  Features Used:
- Date of journey  
- Airline  
- Source & destination  
- Route & stops  
- Departure & arrival time  
- Flight duration

####  Business Applications:
- Helps travelers estimate flight costs  
- Assists travel agencies with pricing strategy  
- Enables businesses to budget travel costs

### **Project 2: Customer Satisfaction Prediction**

- **Goal:** Predict whether a passenger is satisfied with their flight experience.
- **Techniques Used:** Classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, MLflow, Streamlit  
- **Dataset:** `Passenger_Satisfaction.csv`

####  Features Used:
- Demographics (Age, Gender)  
- Travel details (Type, Class, Distance)  
- Ratings for services (WiFi, Cleanliness, Boarding, etc.)  
- Departure/Arrival delays  
- Final satisfaction label (Satisfied / Dissatisfied / Neutral)

####  Business Applications:
- Enhances customer experience  
- Guides service improvement efforts  
- Aids in customer segmentation & retention
